# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Objective
I applied supervised machine learning to analyze credit card risk. Supervised machine learning was used because the data provided is labeled and I wanted to predict the output.  Credit risk is an unbalanced classification problem due to good loans outnumbering the bad.  Imbalanced classification is caused by an unequal distribution of classes in the dataset.  Therefore, I used different techniques to train and evaluate the models using resampling.

### Tasks
- Deliverable 1: Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk
- Deliverable 2: Use the SMOTEENN Algorithm to Predict Credit Risk
- Deliverable 3: Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk
- Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Credit Risk Analysis (README.md)

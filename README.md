# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Objective
I applied machine learning to analyze credit card risk.  Credit risk is an unbalanced classification problem due to good loans outnumbering the bad.  Imbalanced classification is caused by an unequal distribution of classes in the dataset.  Therefore, I used different techniques to train and evaluate the models using resampling.

### Tasks
Deliverable 1: Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk
Deliverable 2: Use the SMOTEENN Algorithm to Predict Credit Risk
Deliverable 3: Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk
Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Credit Risk Analysis (README.md)
